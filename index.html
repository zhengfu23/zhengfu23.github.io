            <div id="intro">
                <p>Technology is transforming our everday lives. I would like to transform the way people live in their own homes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">IoT</a> (picture from canvs.org), or internet of things, is a network consists of all everyday "things" that we use with embedded electronics in them. Things can communicate with each other, transfer data with or without human interaction. This introduced a whole lot of Artificial intelligence components as well as automation.</p>
                <p>This is where I come in. There are a lot of possibilities and existing devices on the market, but they are either ridiculously high priced or very hard to integrate into everyday life.</p>
                <p>Imagine your lights turn on without you even thinking of it.</p>
                <p>Imagine your enviroment adapts to your habit and even mood.</p>
                <p>Imagine your home truly cares and knows about you.</p>
                <p id="catchphrase">Welcome to the future.</p>
